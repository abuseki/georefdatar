Description: The package includes reference data sets commonly used in 
  geosciences, such as the standard atomic weights of elements, a periodic 
  table, a mineral list, reservoir reference datasets (continental crust, 
  mantle, basalts, etc.), decay constants, and isotopic ratios frequently used 
  in geochronology. Additionally, the package provides functions for basic 
  queries of atomic weights and mineral lists. All datasets have complete 
  references, making them citable.
