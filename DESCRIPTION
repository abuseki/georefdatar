Description: The package provides some reference data sets that are regularly
  used in geosciences. These are a periodic table of the elements, a list of
  minerals and some reservoir reference data set (continental crust, mantle,
  basalts, ...). Some functions for basic queries of the periodic table of the
  elements and the list of minerals are also included. All data sets have full
  references, making them citable.
