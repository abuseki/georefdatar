Description: Reference datasets commonly used in geosciences. Such as the 
  standard atomic weights of elements, a periodic table, a mineral list and 
  their abbreviations, reservoir reference datasets (continental crust, mantle, 
  basalts, etc.), decay constants and isotopic ratios frequently used in 
  geochronology. Additionally, the package provides functions for basic queries 
  of atomic weights and the mineral list. All datasets have complete references,
  making them citable.
