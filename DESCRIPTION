Description: The package contains some reference datasets that are regularly
  used in geosciences. These are a periodic table of the elements, a list of
  minerals and some reservoir reference data set (continental crust, mantle,
  basalts, ...). Some functions for basic queries of the periodic table of the
  elements and the list of minerals are also included. All records have full
  references, making them citable.
