## georefdatar 0.6.5.9002

Added the Goldschmidt's classification of the elements
(litho-, chalco-, sidero- and atmophile) to the element sets.

## georefdatar 0.6.5.9001

Changed the mineral list from using the RRUFF list to using the list in the 
supplementary material of Warr (2021).\
The Warr (2021) list also includes group names. This makes it more  practical 
for use in a general earth science context, where one often wants to or needs 
to refer to a group of minerals. E.g. amphibole, biotite, pyroxene, ...\
In the RRUFF list these groups are not mentioned because the are not minerals,
strictly speaking.
