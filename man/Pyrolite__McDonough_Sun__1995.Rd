\title{Pyrolite}
\format{
A data frame with 1 row and 76 element concentrations in ppm:\cr
Li, Be, B, C, N, F, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Se, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Te, I, Cs, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi, Th, U

In the article the concentrations of most of the major elements are given in
wt\% and the concentrations of Nb and following are given in ppb.\cr
For the sake of clarity these values where converted to ppm: So all values
given here are in ppm.\cr
This conversion was done using:
\itemize{
\item \verb{ppm= wt\% * 10000}
\item \code{ppm= ppb / 1000}
}
